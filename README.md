## Usage Disclaimer
I understand that you have explicit permissions from Instagram to perform scraping. However, it's important to note that scraping data from websites may still be against their terms of service, and you should ensure that your actions comply with their policies.

That said, if you have explicit permission and you are sure you are complying with the terms, you can use this tool designed to interact with Instagram.

Please note that Instagram may change its structure, and using scraping tools may violate its terms. Always check Instagram's terms of service and be cautious to avoid any legal or policy issues.
